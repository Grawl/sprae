* [x] finish directives
* [ ] better list diffing
* [?] ordered directives init (:each + :if vs :if + :each) -> find out if really needed and which is faster
* [?] autoinit -> too much maintenance burden
* [ ] node tests
* [ ] better deps updating -> cumulative signal
* [ ] combinations: :else :if, :each :if, :if :each
* [ ] :with must be able to set state value as well
